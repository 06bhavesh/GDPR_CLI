GDPR/AI Risk CLI

Built this in 7 days to practice C++ and learn GDPR compliance stuff.

What it does:
- Asks 8 key GDPR questions 
- Scores your risk level (Low/Medium/High)
- Exports a professional report.

How to run it:
Just type this:
g++ -std=c++17 *.cpp -o gdpr_cli.exe (compilation command)
./gdpr_cli.exe (command to run the file)

Menu options:
1. Answer questions
2. See your previous results  
3. Export report to file
4. Quit

Why I made it:
I've done C++ before but got curious about GDPR. Wanted to practice my basic 
coding skills with that. Learned GDPR basics along the way.

Files:
main.cpp - the menu and main logic
questions.cpp/h - all the GDPR questions
scoring.cpp/h - the risk math
specs.md - original project idea
